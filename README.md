# Fast-Food-Simulator-with-Python-and-Pandas


To run this program, you will need to follow these steps:

Open the file in a Python environment such as Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
Run the code cells one by one in the order they appear in the notebook.
Make sure to copy the notebook to your own drive before making any changes.
You should only modify the code cells and not the markdown cells.
The program reads two data files: menu.csv and foods.csv from Dropbox URLs. Make sure you have internet connectivity to access these files.
After running all the cells, the output will be generated in the last cell which simulates a fast-food ordering system.
Note that this program is designed to simulate a fast-food ordering system and does not involve any actual food or food ordering. It is purely a programming exercise.
